# Spotify-User-Churn-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This project builds an interpretable machine learning–based churn prediction system for Spotify that uses behavioral signals (listening habits, skips, subscription type, engagement) to identify high‑risk users and explain why they might leave, enabling proactive, targeted retention campaigns.
